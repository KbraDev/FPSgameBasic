# FPS Games Basics

In this repo, you will find some basic features of an FPS game made in Godot 4.3.

It is mainly focused on basic mechanics (movement, shooting), camera nodes, enemies, etc.

This "game" is my first FPS, following Lukifah's playlist. On his channel, he has multiple tutorials on game development.
